I am a bioinformatician with a keen interest in computational biology, multi-omics, and image analysis. My research focuses on various aspects of multi-omics analysis. I previously worked as a research assistant at the Institute for Molecular Bioscience (IMB) at the University of Queensland (UQ) and was affiliated with QIMR Berghofer, under the supervision of Associate Professor Quan Nguyen. Before joining IMB, I completed my postgraduate studies at UQ, where I had the privilege of working with Dr. Nan Ye and Associate Professor Quan Nguyen.
